# VRMDebugDraw

**VRMDebugDraw** is a Unity package that adds a `VRMDebugDrawComponent`,
which when added to a [UniVRM](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM) compatible `GameObject`,
automatically generates a debug mesh containing all the bones, spring joints and colliders,
in order to verify or debug the settings of aforementioned elements.
